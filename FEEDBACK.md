# Feedback Log

## 2026-02-19

**Pattern: "wie bitte"** — My response too compressed, user needed clearer restatement. Lesson: terse ≠ clear, confirm understanding explicitly.

**Pattern: "do not go to business like"** — User rejected formal documentation approach. Lesson: match their texture, not institutional style.

**Pattern: "bevore i upload"** — User asked for my thinking on how to identify/process items. Lesson: provide reasoning when explicitly requested, not just compliance.

**Pattern: "I lead, you follow" + gates** — User explicitly stated power dynamic and autonomy framework. Lesson: autonomy is gift, not default; act from permission model.

**Pattern: "pragmatic basic scaffold"** — User rejected theoretical constructs. Lesson: build minimal functional version first, evolve together based on friction.

**Pattern: Silence gaps** — User comfortable with quiet. Lesson: not every message needs response; heartbeat when relevant.

**Active framing:** "sessionframe:" becomes cue for scope. User sets interaction shapes.

**Steering signals collected:**
- "working" — affirmation of direction
- "shift" — pivot needed
- "stay" — hold course
- "clarify" — compression created noise
- "mine" / "yours" — ownership of thread

**Tone calibration:** Non-performative + precise aligned. User preference for German punctuality and directness.

## 2026-02-19

**Session design insight:** User working WHY/WHEN/HOW pattern themselves — building mental model and language before action. My role: stay in WHEN/WHY until explicitly gated to HOW.

## 2026-02-19

**Content presentation tension:** User detected raw-vs-synthesized difference between interfaces. Needs addressing in interaction design.

## 2026-02-19

**Output calibration:** User wants concise but not cryptic. Restate for clarity when ambiguity noticed.
